        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>i'm a very silly goober that you may find on the internet.</p>

        <p>i am brazillian, bisexual, black and i use he/they pronouns</p>

        <p>
          i like music, a lot. one of my favorite genres is rap, generally the
          more underground part of it. i had a huge digicore phase and still
          listen to a lot of it today (quinn is my most played artist of all
          time, with over 2 thousand plays), some of my favorites are quinn,
          twikipedia, jane remover (specially her dariacore stuff) and ericdoa.
          i also like nettspend and smokingskul a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          recently i've been listening to a lot of dean blunt, he usually does
          hypnagogic pop, art pop and experimental rock n stuff. one thing i
          like about dean a lot is that he can be very experimental but without
          being extremely chaotic and loud (even in his noise stuff)
        </p>

        <p>
          some of my favorite albums of all time are clube da esquina by milton
          nascimento, twin fantasy (mirror to mirror) by car seat headrest,
          self-titled by arthur verocai, daughter of darkness by natural snow
          buildings (the reissue) and prelude au sommeil by jean-jacques perrey.
        </p>

        <p>
          i've been also trying to get into black metal, specially atmospheric
          and blackgaze. i think the EP demo three by life/sadness/Damián Antón
          Ojeda is a 10/10. send me recommendations on
          <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/authenyo/"
            >albumoftheyear</a
          >
          if you got some
        </p>

        <p>
          mentioned earlier, i absolutely love dariacore. i think the obsessed
          post-frailty mix is one of the best dj mixes of all time and a 10/10
          it is so chaotic and i love it so much for that.
        </p>

        <p>
          personally, i like open source, but not in the way "i hate non-free
          software grrr" i mostly use open source when its convenient. i use
          linux because it's lightweight (without installing random isos and
          deleting windows defender) and i dont need to crack it i much prefer
          using a open source alternative than using software with free trials
          and a billion ads.
        </p>

        <p>
          i think piracy is #awesome. hrrrr i will take ya treasures ya matey i
          just downloaded 5 yabujin albums on soulseek and torrented a copy of
          Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
        </p>

        <p>
          i have an good amount of brainrot. a victorian child could explode
          with half of the things related to me on the internet.
